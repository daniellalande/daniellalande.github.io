        <div class="pLabelContainer">
          <p>As part of my fourth year of study in design, I had the opportunity to realize a project in collaboration
            with the CEA in Grenoble.<br><br>The request of this project was to realize an immersive device allowing to
            represent in a graphic way the role played by the CEA in the field of the cybersecurity. To do so, we
            decided to use the immersive projection room of the Yspot to project a large particle system representing,
            in an abstract way, a computer network in which malwares would hide.<br><br>The goal of the installation is
            to move in the digital system with the help of a tablet in order to find the different types of malwares
            hidden in the network.</p>
